# A Base Steal Predictor using MLB data

For this project, I examined if it was possible to predict whether or not a base steal woudl be successful using MLB data. I utilized a Google BigQuery dataset provided to them by Sportsradar that contained information on every play from the 2016 season. More context for this project can found on this [blog post]

**Repository Structure**

* Data: A couple of raw data files from the MLB dataset that was utilized filtered down and utilized by my project.
* Flask: Flask app that I built utilizing my model. Copy of this is on different [repo] which was deployed on Heroku.
* Presentation: Slide deck which provided an overview of my project.
* stealingbases_MVP.md: Document describing my minimum viable product for this project.
